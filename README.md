# Sally the Chatbot (Portfolio Project with NLTK and Deep Learning)
 Chatbot project for portfolio



## Project Description

Sally is a first draft of a chatbot that was learned trough a simple neural network, that recognizes and respond adequately to some predefined intents. It works for an imaginary moped store, therefore sentences should be related to that.

As for now it solely runs in the console, may change later.

The motivation behind this project was to get some first hand, programming and AI experience to underline my pre-master in Artificial Intelligence at the Radboud University.

I choose to use NLTK for NLP(Natural Language Processing) and PyTorch for the neuronal networks.
